# QUESTION 1

``` r
set.seed(12345)

mydataframe <- tibble(
                  random_sample = rnorm(10),
                  logical_vec = random_sample > 0,
                  char_vec = c("My", "name", "is", "Tanvir", "Khan", "and", "I", "like","the", "Lakers"),
                  fac_vec = factor(c("single", "single", "single", "single", "married", "married", "married", "divorced", "divorced", "divorced")),
)

knitr::kable(mydataframe)

``` r
rnorm_mean = mean(pull(mydataframe, random_sample))
logicalvec_mean = mean(pull(mydataframe, logical_vec))
charvec_mean = mean(pull(mydataframe, char_vec))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(mydataframe, char_vec)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
facvec_mean = mean(pull(mydataframe, fac_vec))
## Warning in mean.default(pull(mydataframe, fac_vec)): argument is not numeric or
## logical: returning NA
```

When I take the mean of the random sample of size 10 variable from a
standard Normal distribution, the mean function works on this and it
gives me a value. This works because it contains numeric value. I can
take the mean of a numeric value.

When I take the mean of the logical vector, the mean functions work on
this logical vector even though that does not make sense. If someone
looks at the data frame they will see that the logical vector in my data
frame displays True and False. The True is being converted to 1 and
False is being converted to 0. I have four True out of 10 and that is
0.4 which is the same value as the mean function is outputting.

When I take the mean of the character vector and factor vector, the
console output is displaying a warning message that states the argument
is not numeric or logical: “Returning NA”. This makes sense for the
character vector since I can not take the mean of a character vector
which does not have numeric values. The factor vector is not numeric or
logical.

``` r
numeric_char = as.numeric(pull(mydataframe,char_vec))
numeric_logv = as.numeric(pull(mydataframe, logical_vec))
numeric_fac = as.numeric(pull(mydataframe, fac_vec))
```

When I attempted to convert the elements in the character vector, NA is
returned. The elements in the character vector are characters/letters
and we can’t convert words or letters to numbers. When I convert the
elements from the logical vector to numeric, it displays 0 and 1. 0’s
indicate True and 1’s indicate False. When I convert elements of the
factor vector to numeric, 3,2,1 are displayed. I believe that the 3,2,1
are numeric codes for the three different levels of the factor.

``` r
mean_numchar = mean(numeric_char)
mean_numlogic = mean(numeric_logv)
mean_numfactor = mean(numeric_fac)
```

When I take the mean of the converted character vector, it gives me NA
because I did not successfully convert character vector elements to
numeric elements. When I take the mean of the numeric converted logical
vector, I get the mean of 0.4 because R is handling True’s as 0 and
False as 1. When I take the mean of the numeric converted factor vector,
I get the mean of 2.1 which is the mean of the different levels of the
factor vector.

``` r
numeric_factorvec = as.numeric(as.character(pull(mydataframe, fac_vec)))
```

After doing some research on google, I found out that since my factor
vector has character text like “single”, “married”, “divorce”, I will
not be able to convert to numeric even if I use the as.character()
function. If the factor vector contained elements that are numbers like
c(123,243,3232,412,51) then I may convert that to character by using
as.character(). This will represent those exact numbers in text format
and then I may do one additional conversion to numeric by using the
as.numeric(). This will give me the exact values that was stored in the
factor vector.

# QUESTION 2

``` r
data("penguins", package = "palmerpenguins")


myspecies = distinct(penguins, species, na.rm = TRUE)
#pengsex <- penguins %>% select(sex) %>% filter(!is.na(sex))
```

1.  The important variables are *species, island, bill\_length\_mm,
    bill\_depth\_mm, flipper\_length\_mm, body\_mass\_g, sex, year*.

2.  The unique **species** in the penguins data table are *Adelie,
    Gentoo, Chinstrap*.

3.  The unique **island** in the penguins data table are *Torgersen,
    Biscoe, Dream*.

4.  The unique **years** in the penguins data table are *2007, 2008,
    2009*.

5.  The sex in the penguins data table are male, female.

6.  The mean of the **bill length** is *43.92* and the standard
    deviation of the bill length is *5.46*.

7.  The mean of the **bill depth** is *17.15* and the standard deviation
    of the bill depth is *1.97*.

8.  The mean of the **body mass** is *4201.75* and the standard
    deviation of the body mass is *801.95*.

``` r
penguin_scatterplot <- ggplot(penguins, aes(x = bill_length_mm, y = flipper_length_mm, color = species)) +
  geom_point(shape = penguins$species, size = 3) +
  ggtitle("Flipper vs Bill Length") + theme(plot.title = element_text(hjust = 0.5))
